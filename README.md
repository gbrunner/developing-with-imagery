## Description
You know what NDVI means. You have already learned what a digital elevatio model is and what it can be used for. You even know a little bit or raster algebra. What you really want to know, however, is *how do I create and maintain a [global Landast image service](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/)?*  *How do I use Python to interface with Image Services?* *What can I do with motion video and frone drone imagery?*  In **Enterprise Imagery Management, Dissemination, and Analysis**, you will learn how to create global imagery mosaics, write and implement advanced imagery analysis algorithms, apply these analytical methods at scale using AWS and raster analyics. You will also learn techniques for processing and analysing imagery collected by drones and other highly oblique imagery datasets.
