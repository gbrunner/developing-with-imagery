# enterprise-imagery-management-dissemination-analysis
Repo for develping materials for a class in Enterprise Imagery Management, Dissemination, and Analysis

## Description
You know what NDVI means. You have already learned what SAR is and how to use it. You even know a little bit or raster algebra. What you really want to knoww, however, is *how does Esri create and maintain their [global Landast service](https://aws.amazon.com/earth/)?*  *How do I use Python to interface with ArcGIS Image Services?* *What can I do with drone imagery?*  In **Enterprise Imagery Management, Dissemination, and Analysis**, you will learn how to create global imagery mosaics, write and implement advanced imagery analysis algorithms, apply these analytical methods at scale using AWS and raster Analyics.
