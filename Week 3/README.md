# ["Raster Function, What's Your Function"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPoBE-E8VOc)
This lecture will focus on the concept of raster functions

# Preparation
1. Watch:
    - [DevSummit 2018 - Raster Analysis and Image Processing in ArcGIS Enterprise](https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=zgL7pcQgMbk) 
    - [Raster Analysis with SA and Python](https://www.esri.com/videos/watch?videoid=1jx5uRwLld8)

# Lecture
Raster funciton cans can be applied to imagery layer or embeded into mosaic dataset and image service.
## 1. Applying Raster Functions to elevation
- Hillshade on DEM from homework

- Slope Embeded in NED image service.

- Embed Ampect into DEM from homework.

## 2. Slope and Aspect Algorithms in Python using GDAL

## 3. Pansharpening SpaceNet Dataset
- What is pansharpening?
- Pansharpening methods?
- Pansharpening raster function.
- Pansharpening a SpaceNet image over Georgia.

# Exercise\Homework
1. Apply the NDVI raster function to the Landsat OLI Mosaic dataset we created last week. After you apply the NDVI function, apply a colramp to the result to emphasize the contrast. **Submit the Raster Function chain (NDVI + Colorramp).**

2. Using Python GDAL, create a Jupyter Notebook where you write a function that computes the NDVI of a Landsat OLI dataset and takes in the right OLI Bands to compute NDVI for a selected scene. Pull the scenes directly from Landsat in AWS. Do this for the same geographic area where you applied the NDVI function in ArcGIS Pro. How do the results compare? DO they look the same? **Submit the Notebook.**

3. Create a raster function that
